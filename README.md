# Project-Euler
Solved problems from Project Euler using Python.

### Description
Project Euler gives us a chance to prove our problem-solving skills.

### How to use this repository
We have, for each problem, a folder named after the problem name (as per Project Euler), with inside a `src/` folder and a `test/` folder where tests are carried out (if needed). At the root, I might include another `.md` file to describe and document my logic, as well as some relevant facts/statistics provided as feedback (if present) by Project Euler.
Ben and I will present our solutions to this website problems in the respective directories.

### Planning for the future
For now, this repository will only include Project Euler's problems.
